mongo management studio in java

First, I'm not a java developer, I usually work in .net and windows environments. This is my attempt to try to get out of my confort zone and learn something new.
The idea is to create a system to handle mongodb in a cool visual ide. Going further I'd like to be able to exchange repositories and use the same
app to explore ravendb and other nosql db.

All contribution are appreciated, also from a stilistic point of view in java.

Cheers
